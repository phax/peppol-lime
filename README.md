# peppol-lime
An up-to-date implementation of the PEPPOL LIME protocol. 
It is based on the discontinued CIPA libraries.
No new functionality is added, but the existing dependencies are kept up-to-date.

This version of the LIME server uses AS2 to forward messages to foreign APs. START is no longer supported!
